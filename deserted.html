            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                For my capstone project for my Bachelor's in Computer Science degree, I teamed up with a group of friends to create a 4 player co-operative game.
                We decided to base the setting on our trip to Death Valley National Park, and focus the theme on cleaning up trash within the park.
                We developed the game in Unity and coded everything in C#.
            </p>

            <h3>Contribution</h3>
            <p>
              My primary role on the team was to design or source every single asset within the scene. This involved developing characters, animating them, creating a level
              as well as designing sound effects and music. I have a background in Adobe Illustrator so it wasn't too hard to create our cast of characters. I took inspiration 
              from our time in Death Valley National Park, and created a level with accompanying art to go along with it. The design of the characters is heavily inspired by the Paper Mario franchise. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The character animations were designed in Adobe After Effects. They include an Idle, Jumping, and Running animation. Once these animations were created, 
                they were inserted into Unity's Animation Controller, a finite state machine that decides that animation to run depending on the state of the character.
            </p>

            <p>
                The music was created in Ableton Live, and is completely original. The sound effects are also completely original.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to these design elements, I aided in writing the script for the power-ups that drop into the level. We had 4 power-ups to choose from, a Time Freeze Clock, 
                A Trash Destroying Bomb, A Player Speeding Lightning Bolt, and Infintie Throwing Arrow. 
            </p>
